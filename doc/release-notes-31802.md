- Two new binaries are added to the release: `bitcoin-node` (or `bitcoin -m node`) and `bitcoin-gui` (or `bitcoin -m gui`). These enable IPC functionality, initially only for the (experimental) Mining interface. Building the binaries is controlled by `ENABLE_IPC` (enabled by default, except for Windows). When building from source without depends, `capnp` needs to be installed. (#31802)
